                <p>
                    Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, and futurist who is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system. Born in Smiljan, Croatia, Tesla's mind was a whirlwind of energy and ideas that would eventually illuminate the world.

                        <p>Born on July 10, 1856, during a fierce lightning storm—a fitting beginning for the man who would master electricity. He possessed an eidetic memory and a brilliant imagination.</p>

                        <p>Moving to the United States in 1884 with just four cents and a letter of recommendation, Tesla quickly became a pivotal figure in the 'War of Currents'.</p>

                        <p>Tesla's AC system allowed electricity to be transmitted over long distances efficiently. It powered the 1893 World's Fair and the first large-scale hydroelectric plant at Niagara Falls.</p>
                        <h3>The Tesla Coil</h3>
                        <p>Invented in 1891, this transformer circuit is used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high-frequency alternating-current electricity.</p>
                        <h3>Wireless Communication</h3>
                        <p>Tesla's work with radio-frequency waves laid the foundation for modern radio, remote controls, and even predicted our current mobile communication networks.</p>
